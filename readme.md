## Description
I had this edgy idea to make a chunky old school Arduino thing that fits the feather form factor. USB-B port and a 3V regulator make this compatible with most featherwings, there's even the built_in LED on PIN 13 to get your blinkies starting.

## Details
This section can be used to explain everything about your project.
Can be upgraded to the Atmega328P of course, but the main goal was to have an Atmega8 DIP feather, mostly to trigger people, but the idea grew on me. Also: everyone probably has a DIP Atmega8 laying around somewhere, doing nothing - this board will give it something to do.
